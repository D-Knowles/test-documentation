# Welcome to Labtrac



Thank you for choosing Labtrac and welcome to the Labtrac family of over 200 Laboratories in the UK who have run their systems successfully over the last 20 years.


This document provides a guide to implementating Labtrac, covering the sequence of events and particularly what you will need to prepare for.


Some contact numbers that you may find useful:

**Labtrac Support/Sales - 03333 449970**

***(all calls charged at local rate)***


These Numbers are available during 9:00 to 5:30 Monday to Thursday and 9:00 to 5:00 on Fridays, excluding Bank Holidays.

If an issue is non-urgent then it is best to contact us using the **[support@labtrac.com](mailto:support@labtrac.com)** email, explain what the issue is in as much detail as possible and provide contact names and numbers.
When we need to carry out any training or need to access your system to resolve any issues we have invested in the TeamViewer software package and this allows us to access your system with your permission.

## Installation of the Labtrac Software


* Firstly you need to install TeamViewer on all PC's which will have Labtrac on. To do this please follow these instructions:



+ Open an internet browser and go to labtrac.com



* Click on the tap in the top right corner labelled *Support*.



+ On this page, under where *Support* is , it will say *Labtrac Remote Support Client*. Click this link and it will start a download which you can say *Run* to.



* This will then open the *TeamViewer* Installer. The first thing you will need to enter in this page is *How do you want to use TeamViewer* to which you should select *Both of the above*.


+ Next it will ask you to agree to the terms of the license.



+ Once you have agreed it will then ask for a password. This should be a password which you can tell the Labtrac Support team.



+ After you have entered the Password then change the name of the PC to your lab name **eg. Knutsford Dental-PC 1** and click *Finish*



* This Process will take 4 or 5 minutes for each PC.



* Once the TeamViewer link is available, the Labtrac Support Team can then proceed to install the latest Labtrac version on your PC and this will take around 20-30 minutes depending on broadband speeds and the modules that you have taken. Once this has been completed we can then start the Labtrac [data build](/documentation/getting-started) stage.
