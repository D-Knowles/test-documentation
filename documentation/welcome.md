# Welcome to Labtrac



Thank you for choosing Labtrac and welcome to the Labtrac family of over 200 Laboratories in the UK who have run their systems successfully over the last 20 years.


This document provides a guide to implementating Labtrac, covering the sequence of events and particularly what you will need to prepare for.


Some contact numbers that you may find useful:

**Labtrac Support/Sales - 03333 449970**

***(all calls charged at local rate)***


These Numbers are available during 9:00 to 5:30 Monday to Thursday and 9:00 to 5:00 on Fridays, excluding Bank Holidays.

If an issue is non-urgent then it is best to contact us using the **[support@labtrac.com](mailto:support@labtrac.com)** email, explain what the issue is in as much detail as possible and provide contact names and numbers.
When we need to carry out any training or need to access your system to resolve any issues we have invested in the TeamViewer software package and this allows us to access your system with your permission.

# Labtrac Installation

When we need to Install Labtrac, carry out any training or resolve any issues we use TeamViewer. TeamViewer is a piece of software that allows us to remotely access your system, with your permission.

To install TeamViewer please follow these steps.

* Go to labtrac.com/en/support

* Under support click ***Labtrac Remote Support Client***. This will start a download of the software. When that has downloaded 'Run' the Installer.

* Follow the instructions and go through the installer.

* When it asks for a PC name please enter your lab name to allow us to find you in our list of PC's.

* Enter a password. Please dont make this a personal password as you will need to tell the members of the Labtrac Support team.

* This Process will take 4 or 5 minutes for each PC.

Once the TeamViewer link is available, the Labtrac Support Team can then proceed to install the latest Labtrac version on your PC and this will take around 20-30 minutes depending on broadband speeds and the modules that you have taken.
