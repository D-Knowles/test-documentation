## Posting a Payment



+ Once we are in Payment Entry find the dentist who you wish to post a payment against and double click on them. This will open a new window which will show all outstanding invoices for this Dentist. 



+ First we need to select what type of payment this is (BACS, Cheque, Credit Note or a Discount) from the list on the left hand side.



+ Next we can enter the *Amount*.



+ Then we can put in a *Reference* and/or *Details* these fields are not mandatory but can help keep track of payment infomation.



+ Next we can set the date the payment has been made.



+ Finally all we need to then do is select the relevant invoice the payment is against and click the check box on the left hand side of that.



+ Once we have all that we can click post in the top right and that is the payment posted.

+ Double click on *Reverse a Payment*. This will bring up a list of all the payments you have entered. Once you have found the relevant payment infomation double click on the left hand side of the row. This will then bring up another payment screen.
