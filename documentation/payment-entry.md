## Posting a Payment

To enter a Payment or Credit Note go to **Payment Entry** in the contents bar.

Select the account, from the list, that you would like to post the payment against. You can search by clicking **Search** at the top of the contents bar.

This will open a new window.

Enter the **Amount**, **Payment Date** and choose whether to **Include Discount** (select this if you are giving any discount on the outstanding invoices).

Select if the **Payment Type** is **Cheque**, **BACS** or **Credit Note**

Enter a **Reference** and **Details** 

Then go through and tick every invoice in the list which the payment covers. If the payment does not clear an invoice you can either leave the invoice with a balance or discount the remaining amount. This is done by selecting **Include Discount** after entering the **Amount** and **Payment Date**.
