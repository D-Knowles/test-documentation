# Data Build

### Things to Consider Before Getting Started

Now you have Labtrac set up, you will need to enter all required data (Dentists, Products, Materials etc)

### Price Lists

It is important that before you start entering any information you have in mind your price lists that are used for all dentists. When entering either the Dentist you will need to know which price list the dentist is on and when entering products and materials you will need to know the price for every price list you use.

### Dentist Codes

Every dentist in Labtrac needs a unique code. If you already haev a coding system in place then you can carry on with that. If not we recommend using the first 4 letters of the surname followed by 01 (in case of duplicates then 02, 03, 04 etc).

Labtrac allows a dentist code of up to 8 characters.

EG.

* WRIG01 - Owen Wright
* WRIG02 - Michael Wright


### Product Codes

When setting up product codes in Labtrac there are a few things to bear in mind;

* There must be a product code for every standard of work that you do. Meaning if you do NHS, Independent and Private work then you will need 3 codes for each product. In the example below the code (PBC - for Porcelain Bonded Crown) is suffixed with either a N, I or P depending on the standard.

	* **PBC-N** for (NHS) Porcelain Bonded Crown
	* **PBC-I** for (Independent) Porcelain Bonded Crown
	* **PBC-P** for (Private) Porcelain Bonded Crown

### Delivery Methods

* To set up how the dentists recieve the work open Delivery Details from the content bar on the left side of the screen.

* This opens a list of all your Delivery Methods to add a new one click 'Add' in the bottom left.

* Select the Run number, which will identify this particular method of delivery.

* Select the Days. This is the amount of time you want to allow for the job to arrive in surgery after leaving the Lab.

* Enter the details in the Delivery Method section(eg Postal, Courier, Hand Delivered etc)

* The Rep and Sales Area boxes are optional additional infomation, it is not needed to set up a Run.

# Adding a Dentist


To add a new Dentist first, click **'Dentist'** in the contents bar then **'Add F2'** at the top of the Labtrac screen.

![Adding a Dentist](/test-documentation/images/gs_1.png "Adding a Dentist"){: .center-block}


Once you have entered a code and name click **'Add'**

This will open the dentist details page.

Select whether the dentist is the principal or an associate. If the dentist is selected as the principal this means they receive all their own invoices and handle their own account. If they are selected as an associate you can select whether to invoice the principal or associate.

Next you can enter an address. The first address being the practice address and the 2nd the invoicing address. If these are the same, you can use the copy address button once you have entered the practice address.

(If the dentist is selected as an associate you can use the **'copy address'** button next to the principal’s name to copy their address into all address fields).

Once the address is entered you can then choose from the invoicing options. 

The first check box is 'invoiced' if the dentist is selected as the principal this will be greyed out as a principal must be the one to receive their invoice. If the dentist is selected as an associate, then the invoiced box is optional.

If invoiced is selected - The associate receives and handles their own invoice. This means they pay their own account.
If invoiced is NOT selected - The principal handles the associates invoices. The principal handles and pays the associate’s invoices.

The next thing to look at is 'Price List' *here* and 'Volume Discount' *here* make sure the dentist is selected on the correct list or discount.

The first thing to enter in the new window is the 'Category'.

If you have never set up any categories before you will have to click  the box next to the drop down menu with 3 dots.

The categories are optional but are a good way of seperating the lab into different areas - this will allow you to run reports on different aspects of the lab.

The categories can be whatever you like.

EG:

Crown & Bridge
Orthodontics
Implants
Mouthguards
Dentures
Miscellaneous
etc.

Once you have entered and selected a category we can then move onto standrard.

This will be relevant if you are doing multiple 'standards' of work. (eg. NHS, Independent or Private) or (Standard,Superior, Exceptional etc.)

You will need to set these up in the same way as the categories above.

Once you have selected the standard you can then select whether or not a tooth shade, stump shade or tooth mould are required by selecting the check box. 
*If you select them to be required Labtrac wont allow you to enter a job without this infomation. If you leave these boxes unchecked you still have the option to enter this infomation on a job, however, it is not mandatory.*

Next you can select if you would like to always record a material on the product by checking the box and selecting the material from the dropdown menu. (eg. you may select to always record a gold alloy on a full gold crown as it is a material you would always use) click *here* for more infomation.

Next enter the price, for every *price list* you are going to use.

If you wish to charge tax on a material enter the amount (in %) that you wish to charge. This will only be charge to a dentist set up to receive tax.
